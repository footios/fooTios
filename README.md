I learned programming, in order to get a creative, ethical, challenging and versatile job. Now Iâ€™m hooked! First, I learned Java to become an Android developer. Then, I switched to React (Native). I have more experience with JavaScript and React Native, but Iâ€™m enhancing my TypeScript and React skills. There are more than 6.000 hours of coding and many certificates in my toolkit. And I feel pretty confident with my codings skills!

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
